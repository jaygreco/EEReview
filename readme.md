# EEReview Repo

The sole purpose of this repo is to gather material that would be useful to know during a job interview. All the good stuff will be collated into review.md or review.pdf (not sure if willing to latex or not yet)

## General Overview

* Binary to hex, hex to decimal, etc
* Basic digital logic, inc. truth tables, gates, and flip-flops/latches
   * Boolean algebra theorems?
   * 2’s compliment just for fun —> invert, +1!
   * Basic truth table and logic synthesis
   * Programmable logic: CPLD/FPGA/HDL
* Op-amps, feedback
   * Integrators/differentiators
   * Active filters
   * Comparators/hysteresis
   * Peak detectors
* Passive filters, LRC, frequency response
   * Filter architectures (at least basic knowledge)
   * RC circuits 
* Communication busses (type, char imp, max distance, datarate, multicast/p2p, etc)
   * LAN/gigE
   * USB
   * SPI
   * I2C
   * UART/RS-232
* Power electronics
   * Boost, buck, analysis/design of converters
   * Efficiency and losses
   * Control methods (VC, CC)
   * M(D) for basic converters
* Basic programming questions
* Random design tasks - using common circuit blocks
* Basic EMC/ESD mitigation and practices
   * ESD, RF immunity, RF emissions
   * EMC/EMI requirements, test methods, and theory
* Basic knowledge of controlled impedance, signals, clock rates, etc
   * Microstrip vs stripline, basic transmission line theory
   * Clocks and data rates of common signals (USB, Ethernet)
   * Meandering, propagation delay, rise times
